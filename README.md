## Problem
The purpose of this project is to automate the software development process via building a comprehensive software development and deployment process. The following summarizes the required flow of tasks:

1. Create an application server (virtual machine or container).
2. Install LAMP server as well as any other needed tool in the server.
3. Create a client machine and connect to the server via SSH protocol.
4. Develop a simple web application on the server machine via the client. Your
application should be a simple dictionary application with a database. Simply when the user
inputs a word, your application should return proper machine word from the database.
5. Upload your project code to a remote repository (such as GIT). Make sure that
every team member should upload the code he/she is responsible for.
6. Prepare a Jenkins job that automatically pulls the code from the repository. This
job should compile your code, run it, and deploy it to a container.
7. Prepare a script that automates the steps (4-6) once you modify the application
code.
